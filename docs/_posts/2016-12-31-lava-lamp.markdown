For my ECE Senior Design project my team made an improved Lava Lamp and we won the "Most Marketable Project" Award! [Here](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece445/project.asp?id=1703) is a link to the project.

**The basic idea is that traditional lava lamps are:**
* Slow to heat up and slow to begin "lava-ing"
* Dangerous when left on for too long
* Not very interactive

**Our Improved Lava Lamp Fixes this by:**
* Using a set of heating resistors on a metal plate to heat the lamp faster
* Using temperature sensors and regulating the temperature to safe levels
* Adding Button-Selectable Multi-color LEDs

You can see a time-lapse of a traditional Lava Lamp as well as our Improved version below. The action starts at 0:55 in the first video and about 0:10 or so in the second. Both videos are played at x50 speed.
