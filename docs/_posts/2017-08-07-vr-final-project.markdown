In Spring 2016 I took Steve LaValle's Virtual Reality class. My partner Sifan Wang and I did our final project on data visualization. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/romanomatthew23/dataVisualizationVR).

We used Unity to develop and Oculus Rift DK2's to test. It can also work with a GearVR and most likely a Consumer Version as well! Here are some screenshots of it below.

The last image is of the [Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapidly-exploring_random_tree) animation we created. Also, there is a video of the animation after that.
